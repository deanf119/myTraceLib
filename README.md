# myTraceLib

Custom Trace Library which can be used to see the time trace of threads and processes.

To use the library please put all the code in the main function.

Will soon provide functionality to just add the library to the file you would like to trace.

check lines 222 & 233 of the cpp file for some of my comments ~~ Sheel
